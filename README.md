# LangChain

## üîπ What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a powerful open-source framework that helps developers build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It abstracts away complexity and provides modular building blocks for:

- Interacting with LLMs (like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude, etc.)
- Connecting LLMs with external tools, APIs, documents, and databases
- Creating intelligent agents, chatbots, retrieval-based systems, and more

---

## üî∏ Why is LangChain Needed?

While LLMs are powerful, using them in real-world applications requires more than just sending prompts. You often need to:

- Chain multiple steps together (e.g., extract ‚Üí reason ‚Üí generate)
- Connect to data sources (PDFs, websites, databases)
- Build chatbots that can remember and react
- Use tools/APIs dynamically (e.g., do math, call a calendar)
- Maintain context in conversations
- Store knowledge or memory for the LLM to use

LangChain provides all the utilities to orchestrate these pieces into a full AI system.

## üß© Core Components of LangChain

| Component             | Description                                                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LLMs & ChatModels** | Integrates models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Anthropic, Google, etc.                |
| **Prompts**           | Create flexible and reusable prompt templates                                       |
| **Chains**            | Combine multiple LLM calls into a single pipeline (e.g., extract ‚Üí transform ‚Üí respond) |
| **Agents**            | Let the LLM decide which tools to use based on user input                           |
| **Tools**             | External APIs or functions the LLM can use (e.g., calculator, web search)           |
| **Memory**            | Stores conversation history or facts between steps                                  |
| **Retrievers**        | Pull relevant data from documents, databases, or vector stores                      |
| **VectorStores**      | Store text embeddings for similarity search (used in RAG, QA, etc.)                 |
| **Callbacks**         | Track events and log/debug complex chains                                           |

## Use Cases of LangChain

LangChain is used to build intelligent LLM-powered applications, such as:

### 1. ü§ñ Chatbots / Virtual Assistants
- Multi-turn conversations
- Memory-enabled interactions
- Tool integration (e.g., booking APIs)

### 2. üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Ask questions over PDFs, Notion docs, websites, and databases
- Combine vector search with LLMs for accurate answers

### 3. üß† Agents
- LLM selects and uses tools dynamically
- Examples: booking systems, autonomous AI helpers, developer copilots

### 4. üìÑ Document QA Systems
- Upload documents and ask questions in natural language
- Example: Chat with legal contracts or academic papers

### 5. üõ†Ô∏è Code Generation Pipelines
- Prompt-based coding
- Generate, fix, or refactor code based on user input

### 6. üîÅ Custom Workflows
- Combine APIs, functions, LLM logic, and memory to build custom pipelines
