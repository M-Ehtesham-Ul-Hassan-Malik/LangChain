# LangChain Chains

This repository explores different types of **chains** in [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

## ðŸ§© What Are Chains in LangChain?

Chains in LangChain are modular components that enable you to **orchestrate multiple steps** involving LLMs, prompts, tools, and output parsers. Instead of writing long and repetitive code, chains help you define a **structured flow** of operations.

A chain takes an input, processes it through one or more steps, and returns a structured output â€” making it easy to build complex applications in a clean and scalable way.

## Why Use Chains?

Chains are essential in LangChain for the following reasons:

- **Reusability**: Break down logic into smaller, manageable units  
- **Composability**: Combine various LLM operations in a pipeline  
- **Flexibility**: Easily swap or modify individual steps  
- **Abstraction**: Focus on high-level logic without managing low-level details  
- **Flow Control**: Enable conditional or parallel logic within pipelines

Chains make it easier to **build**, **debug**, and **maintain** intelligent applications that depend on structured reasoning and multiple LLM steps.

## Types of Chains

### 1. Simple Chain

A simple chain consists of a single prompt passed to a language model, followed by structured output parsing. It represents the most basic use case of chains in LangChain.

**Use Case Example**: Ask a question and get a direct answer.

**Example Flow**
```Prompt â†’ Model â†’ OutputParser```

---

### 2. Sequential Chain

A sequential chain connects multiple steps in a **strict order**, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next. This is useful for building linear workflows.

**Use Case Example**: Extract key points â†’ Summarize â†’ Generate a title.
**Example Flow**
```Step 1 â†’ Step 2 â†’ Step 3```

---

### 3. Parallel Chain

A parallel chain allows multiple components or models to **run at the same time**, independently of each other. The outputs from these steps are then combined.
```
    Input  
    /   \  
  A     B  
   \   /  
  Merged Output  
```

**Use Case Example**: Generate summaries from multiple perspectives at once.

---

### 4. Conditional Chain

A conditional chain introduces **branching logic**. Based on some condition (such as classification or a flag), the chain routes the input through different branches.

**Use Case Example**: If sentiment is positive â†’ proceed to response generation; if negative â†’ escalate to human support.
**Example Flow**:
```Prompt â†’ Model â†’ Branch on output â†’ Run appropriate response ```
