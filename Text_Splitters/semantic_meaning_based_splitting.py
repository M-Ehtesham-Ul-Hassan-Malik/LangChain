Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It powers everything from recommendation systems and fraud detection to autonomous vehicles. By recognizing patterns and making predictions, machine learning helps automate decision-making in countless industries, making technology more adaptive and intelligent over time. 
Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a fast-paced indoor sport that requires quick reflexes, precision, and strategic thinking. Played on a rectangular table divided by a net, it demands sharp hand-eye coordination and the ability to anticipate an opponentâ€™s next move.
