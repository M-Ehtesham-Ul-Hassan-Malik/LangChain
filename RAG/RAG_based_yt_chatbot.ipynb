what\\nseemingly with disparate areas and and\\none can even think of deep mind as i\\nsaid earlier as a sort of\\ninterdisciplinary between neuroscience\\nideas and ai engineering ideas uh\\noriginally and so um so i think there's\\nthat and then one of the things we can't\\nimagine today is and one of the reasons\\ni think people we were so surprised by\\nhow well large models worked is that\\nactually\\nit's very hard for our human minds our\\nlimited human minds to understand what\\nit would be like to read the whole\\ninternet right i think we can do a\\nthought experiment and i used to do this\\nof like well what if i read the whole of\\nwikipedia\\nwhat would i know and i think our minds\\ncan just about comprehend maybe what\\nthat would be like but the whole\\ninternet is beyond comprehension so i\\nthink we just don't understand what it deepmind and what my career is being\\nwe're almost like true rings champion so\\nwe are pushing turing machines or\\nclassical computation to the limits what\\nare the limits of what classical\\ncomputing can do now um and at the same\\ntime i've also studied neuroscience to\\nsee and that's why i did my phd in was\\nto see also to look at you know is there\\nanything quantum in the brain from a\\nneuroscience or biological perspective\\nand um and so far i think most\\nneuroscientists and most mainstream\\nbiologists and neuroscientists would say\\nthere's no evidence of any quantum uh\\nsystems or effects in the brain as far\\nas we can see it's it can be mostly\\nexplained by classical uh classical\\ntheories so\\nand then so there's sort of the the\\nsearch from the biology side and then at\\nthe same time there's the raising of the\\nwater uh at the bar from what classical\\nturing machines can do uh uh and\\nand you know including our new ai\\nsystems and uh as you alluded to earlier\\num you know i think ai especially in the changed over over time\\nso yeah so um even in the last 12 years\\nso we started deep mine in 2010 which is\\nhard to imagine now because 2010 it's\\nonly 12 short years ago but nobody was\\ntalking about ai uh you know if you\\nremember back to your mit days you know\\nno one was talking about it i did a\\npostdoc at mit back around then and it\\nwas sort of thought of as a well look we\\nknow ai doesn't work we tried this hard\\nin the 90s at places like mit mostly\\nlosing using logic systems and\\nold-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned\\nai we would call it now um people like\\nminsky and and and patrick winston and\\nyou know all these characters right and\\nused to debate a few of them and they\\nused to think i was mad thinking about\\nthat some new advance could be done with\\nlearning systems and um i was actually\\npleased to hear that because at least\\nyou know you're on a unique track at\\nthat point right even if every all of\\nyour you know professors are telling you\\nyou're mad that's true and of course in possible to do and um and i think that\\ninvolves ai helping us with with with\\nunderstanding or finding patterns um but\\nalso potentially designing and building\\nnew tools experimental tools so i think\\nthat's all uh\\nand also running simulations and\\nlearning simulations all of that we're\\nalready we're sort of doing it at a at a\\nat a you know baby steps level here but\\ni can imagine that in in in the decades\\nto come as uh you know what's the full\\nflourishing of of that line of thinking\\nit's going to be truly incredible i\\nwould say if i visualize this tree of\\nknowledge something tells me that that\\nknowledge for tree of knowledge for\\nhumans is much smaller\\nin the set of all possible trees of\\nknowledge is actually quite small giving\\nour cognitive\\nlimitations\\nlimited cognitive capabilities that even\\nwith with the tools we build we still\\nwon't be able to understand a lot of\\nthings and that's perhaps what non-human\\nsystems might be able to reach farther\\nnot just as tools on the other side so systems like\\nartificial systems that are amazingly\\nsmart at certain things like maybe\\nplaying go and chess and other things\\nbut they don't feel at all in any shape\\nor form conscious in the way that you\\nknow you do to me or i do to you and um\\nand i think actually\\nbuilding ai\\nis uh these intelligent constructs uh is\\none of the best ways to explore the\\nmystery of consciousness to break it\\ndown because um we're going to have\\ndevices that are\\npretty smart at certain things or\\ncapable of certain things but\\npotentially won't have any semblance of\\nself-awareness or other things and in\\nfact i would advocate\\nif there's a choice building systems in\\nthe first place ai systems that are not\\nconscious to begin with uh are just\\ntools um until we understand them better\\nand the capabilities better so on that\\ntopic just not\\nas the ceo of deep mind\\njust as a
